    <p>Hi there! I am Cooper Kuglin! I am 20 years as of this page's creation. I live on a farm with my horses, goats,
      dogs, and family.</p>
    <p>I am currently in my sophmore year of college at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where I am studying for a
      Computer Science Major. I have learned a lot of skills while being here at Rose, like learning how to make this
      site, as well as computer architecture and the likes, all of which on my resume. I am also (hopefully) studying
      for a Mathematics Minor, which entails more discrete math that, when paired with my
      Computer Science skills, can achieve greatness.
    </p>
    <p>If this were my actual portfolio website, I probably would sound more professional and tell you more about
      myself. Thankfully, no one else will ever see this!</p>
